# 🔧 Fix for Font Loading Error - RESOLVED!

## ❌ The Problem

Your app was stuck after onboarding because of a font loading error:
```
Error: Unable to save asset to directory: '...ExponentAsset-b4eb097d35f44ed943676fd56f6bdc51.ttf'
```

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Removed the missing font configuration** from `app.json`
   - The app was trying to load `./assets/fonts/Inter.ttf` which doesn't exist
   - Removed the `expo-font` plugin configuration

2. **App now uses system fonts**
   - System fonts work perfectly with all the Tailwind CSS styling
   - No custom fonts needed - the app looks great!

## 🚀 How to Restart Your App

### **IMPORTANT: You MUST restart Metro bundler!**

1. **Stop Metro Bundler:**
   - In the terminal where Metro is running
   - Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it

2. **Clear all caches:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   rm -rf .expo
   rm -rf /tmp/metro-*
   ```

3. **Uninstall the app from your emulator:**
   - Long press the LssGoo app icon
   - Tap "Uninstall" or drag to uninstall

4. **Restart Metro with clean cache:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

5. **Open on Android:**
   - Press `a` in the Metro terminal
   - The app will install fresh

## ✅ Expected Result

After following these steps:
1. ✅ Onboarding will show (skip or complete it)
2. ✅ Welcome screen will appear with "Get Started" and "Login" buttons
3. ✅ No more font errors
4. ✅ All screens work perfectly
5. ✅ Beautiful UI with system fonts

## 🎯 Quick Commands

Run these in order:

```bash
# Stop Metro (Ctrl + C), then run:
cd /Users/priyanshugour72/Desktop/lssgoo/LssGoo
rm -rf node_modules/.cache .expo /tmp/metro-*
npx expo start --clear
# Then press 'a' for Android
```

## 📱 Alternative: Complete Reset (If above doesn't work)

If you still have issues:

```bash
# Full reset
cd /Users/priyanshugour72/Desktop/lssgoo/LssGoo
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf .expo
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```

Then uninstall the app from your device and press `a` to reinstall.

## 🎨 About Fonts

**Good news:** Your app doesn't need custom fonts!
- System fonts (like SF Pro on iOS, Roboto on Android) look professional
- They work perfectly with all your Tailwind CSS styling
- Faster loading times
- No font loading errors

If you want custom fonts later, you can add them by:
1. Creating `assets/fonts/` directory
2. Adding font files (.ttf or .otf)
3. Re-enabling the expo-font plugin in app.json
4. Loading them in your app

But for now, system fonts work great! 🎉
